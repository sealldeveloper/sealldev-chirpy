> An external contractor has accessed the internal forum here at Forela via the Guest WiFi and they appear to have stolen credentials for the administrative user! We have attached some logs from the forum and a full database dump in sqlite3 format to help you in your investigation.

**Challenge created by:** [blitztide](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/6893)

An initial look at the files shows a `access.log` and a PHPBB database.

## Task 1
> What was the username of the external contractor?

Opening `phpbb.sqlite3` with the DB Browser and going to the `phpbb_users` table, we can see a few users:
```
test
rsavage001
apoole
apoole1
```

Two users have emails:
```
apoole - apoole@contracter.net
apoole1 - apoole1@contracter.net
```

`apoole` has no `user_lastvisit` time, while `apoole1` does, indicating that `apoole` has never successfully logged in or visited a page.

Answer: <mark>apoole1</mark>

## Task 2
> What IP address did the contractor use to create their account?

Looking at the `user_ip` column in `phpbb_users` we can see `apoole1`'s IP address is `10.10.0.78`

Answer: <mark>10.10.0.78</mark>

## Task 3
> What is the post_id of the malicious post that the contractor made?

Going into the `phpbb_posts` table, there are three posts:
```
1 - This is an example post in your phpBB3 installation. Everything seems to be working. You may delete this post if...
2 - <t>Good Afternoon everyone!<br/><br/>I am new to the administration team here at forela, I'd like to take...
9 - <div><style>body {    z-index: 100;}.modal {    position:fixed;    top:0;    left:0;    height:100%;    width:100%;    z-ind...
```

I decide that the post to look into is post 9, the most suspicious looking one:

```js
...
            </div> <a id="start_here" class="anchor"></a>
            <div id="page-body" class="page-body" role="main">

                        </div>

Seems to be impersonating a login page!

Answer: <mark>9</mark>

## Task 4
> What is the full URI that the credential stealer sends its data to?

Reading the code in Task 3, the URL for the username:password form is: `http://10.10.0.78/update.php`

Answer: <mark>http://10.10.0.78/update.php</mark>

## Task 5
> When did the contractor log into the forum as the administrator? (UTC)

Reading the `phpbb_log` table, we can see from the IP `10.10.0.78` a `LOG_ADMIN_AUTH_SUCCESS` event at `1682506392`.

Using an [epoch time converter](https://www.epochconverter.com/), we get Wednesday, April 26, 2023 10:53:12 AM.

Answer: <mark>26/04/2023 10:53:12</mark>

## Task 6
> In the forum there are plaintext credentials for the LDAP connection, what is the password?

Inside the `phpbb_config` table is the entry: `ldap_password`, containing the password.

Answer: <mark>Passw0rd1</mark>

## Task 7
> What is the user agent of the Administrator user?

Going back to `phpbb_log`, we can see the admin user is authenticated by the IP `10.255.254.2` at `1682420947`. If we look for requests in the `access.log` file with that IP, we can see the user agent.

Answer: <mark>Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/112.0.0.0 Safari/537.36</mark>

## Task 8
> What time did the contractor add themselves to the Administrator group? (UTC)

Again inside `phpbb_log`, we can see an event `LOG_USERS_ADDED` which does the following: `a:2:{i:0;s:14:"Administrators";i:1;s:6:"apoole";}`.

This is at `1682506431`, which is our timestamp (once converted).

Answer: <mark>26/04/2023 10:53:51</mark>

## Task 9
> What time did the contractor download the database backup? (UTC)

Reading the `access.log` file for requests from `10.10.0.78`, at the end are these requests:
```
10.10.0.78 - - [26/Apr/2023:12:01:09 +0100] "GET /adm/index.php?sid=eca30c1b75dc3eed1720423aa1ff9577&i=acp_database&mode=backup HTTP/1.1" 200 3770 "http://10.10.0.27/adm/index.php?sid=eca30c1b75dc3eed1720423aa1ff9577&i=25" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/112.0"

10.10.0.78 - - [26/Apr/2023:12:01:53 +0100] "GET /index.php?sid=be3cc6e2de08bafa4044f552813e2cbe HTTP/1.1" 200 3796 "http://10.10.0.27/adm/index.php?sid=eca30c1b75dc3eed1720423aa1ff9577&i=acp_database&mode=backup" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/112.0"
```

The specific request of interest is `/store/backup_...sql.gz`, which is at: 26/Apr/2023:12:01:38 +0100

The challenge asks for UTC so I subtract the +0100.

Answer: <mark>26/04/2023 11:01:38</mark>

## Task 10
> What was the size in bytes of the database backup as stated by access.log?

Inside the requests for the `/store/backup_...sql.gz`, we can see the following splitup for the format:

`IP - - [TIME] - REQUEST RESPONSE_CODE LENGTH REQUEST_URL USER_AGENT`

So our length is: `34707`

Answer: <mark>34707</mark>
